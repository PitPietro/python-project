# All the elements in a NumPy array should be homogeneous. Mathematical operations that are meant to be
# performed on arrays would be extremely inefficient if the arrays were not homogeneous.
# NumPy arrays are faster than Python lists: an array consumes less memory and is convenient to use.
# NumPy uses much less memory to store data and provides a mechanism of specifying the data types.
#
# Elements inside an array are all of the same type, referred to as the array 'dtype'.
#
# An array can be indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers, by booleans, by another array, or by integers.
# The rank of the array is the number of dimensions.
# The shape of the array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.
#
# One way we can initialize NumPy arrays is from Python lists, using nested lists for two- or higher-dimensional data.

This repository contains all the tests about the topic I learn learning in Python, from the very first script I wrote.

## Prerequisites

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or another Python IDE of your choose.

I also suggest you to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) python package manager by following those links:

1. [Anaconda Installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
2. [Configure a Conda virtual environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html)

## Installing

Clone the repository on your computer and test yourself the library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PitPietro/python-project.git
```

Move to the directory where is placed the file you want to execute and type:

```bash
python [file-name].py
# python hello-world.py

# or, in case you only need python3
python3 [file-name].py
# python3 hello-world.py
```
